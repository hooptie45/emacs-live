Emacs is like a mountain - don't run at it with all your might expecting
to leap to the top - you will quickly fatigue and your high expectations
will become a burden rather than a motivation. Instead, give yourself
time and space to steadily progress upwards step by step, and make sure to
occasionally stop to enjoy the beautiful views on your way.
