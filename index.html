<p class="bluey">
<img src="images/animated-cursor.gif" width="7" height="13"/> The terminal cursor blinks at you with that friendly familar frequency. Except for this time, things are different. You paste in the following runes, follow the instructions and then launch Emacs:</p>

<p class="bluey">
<span class="greeny">
bash <(curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/overtone/emacs-live/master/installer/install-emacs-live.sh)
</span>
</p>


  <p class="bluey">
    Energy starts surging through your fingertips. Sparks fly, making
    the shadows grow and flicker ominously around you. You arch your
    back and open your eyes as if for the first time. The text appears
    more vibrant and colourful than you remember. Your fingers dance on
    the keyboard commanding the cursor with a joyful precision and
    control.
  </p>

  <p class="bluey">
    You lean back and marvel as a shimmering swirl of syntactic and
    symantic structures project out of the screen and intertwine with a
    fractal beauty. You watch as meaning recursively unfolds into deeper
    meaning live in front of your eyes. You feel a deep and lasting
    synchronicity form as the boundaries between you and your Emacs
    wash away.

    <em class="yellowy">You and your Emacs Live.</em>
  </p>

<br/>
<p class="pinky">--> A curated Emacs experience</p>

<p class="whitey">Emacs Live is a carefully curated Emacs config which transforms vanilla Emacs from simply an awesome editor into an intense experience. The key is in the curation. Unlike other awesome Emacs config tools such as the starter-kit and helm, Emacs Live embodies a holistic approach creating an all-round package encorporating many independent dependencies yet ensuring that they all work together seemlessly.</p>

<br/>
<p class="pinky">--> Perfect for Clojure hacking<p>

<p class="whitey">Emacs Live was designed from the ground up to create an insane Clojure hacking experience. It ships with more bang than you can pack into a firework and doesn't need a safety tin: <span class="orangey">nREPL support</span>, <span class="orangey">auto completion</span> with <span class="orangey">fuzzy matching</span>, <span class="orangey">snippets</span>, <span class="orangey">docstring lookup</span>, <span class="orangey">paredit</span>, <span class="orangey">rainbow parens</span>, the famous <span class="orangey">cyberpunk colour theme</span> and many more custom modifications. All you need to do is bring along is a version of Leiningen 2.0.</p>

<br/>
<p class="pinky">--> Power features</p>

<p class="whitey">However, Emacs Live isn't just good for Clojure hacking - it's an all-round text manipulation power house. We pack in the amazing <span class="orangey">undo-tree</span>, a <span class="orangey">visual kill-ring</span>, <span class="orangey">gist integration</span>, <span class="orangey">ace jump mode</span>, <span class="orangey">expand region</span>, and much, much more.</p>

<br/>
<p class="pinky">--> Trivial installation</p>
<p class="whitey">Either run the script above, or download the <a class="yellowy" href="https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live/tags">latest release</a>, rename it to <span class="greeny">~/.emacs.d</span> and launch Emacs. That's all - joy awaits.</p>
